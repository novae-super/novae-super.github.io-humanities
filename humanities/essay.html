        <h1>Minorities in the American Revolution, and how they Influenced the war</h1>
        <h2>African Americans</h2>
        <p>Even though African Americans were disregarded, and called savages across the colonies, they played a massive role in how the war turned out. Take for example, Crispus Attucks, a Martyr, was originally a slave, but then escaped and got his unearned freedom, and then went to become a whale hunter, along with his white friends. He was the first American killed in the revolution. Another African American who had a significant impact on the war was Peter Salem. Peter Salem was essential in the revolution, as he killed one of the highest ranked officers during the battle of Bunker Hill. He was rewarded and praised for his sharp shot. Probably one of the most important African Americans in the entire war is James Amistad Lafayette. He was a double agent, but a spy for the Americans against the British, and gave the Americans vital info they needed in order to win the battle of York Town(Coleman, 2021).</p>
        <h2>Women</h2>
        <p>During the Revolutionary War, the wife of John Adams, Abigail Adams, published many books to help with the revolutionary cause, and got both men and women to rally in support of the war, because the new form of government should remember the ladies. If the government were not to remember the ladies, the ladies would have a revolution of their own. Women often followed their husbands into the continental army, to help aid the soldiers. At the bases, women helped cook, clean, and also helped with healing wounded soldiers, sometimes even taking their spots in war. Take for example, Molly Pitcher. It is said that her husband was not only wounded, but was also suffering from immense heat, and so she took her husband's spot at the battle, an artilleryman and helped very much against the British</p>
        <h2>Native Americans</h2>
        <p>Before the revolution even started, colonists were furious due to the British trying to separate the Natives and the colonists(British separated them due to fear of violence). Colonists were also assuming that natives would naturally align with the British, due to the colonists being unfair to the Natives, but the truth was the Natives wanted to avoid getting involved because it would be a family dispute between the king and his subjects; Unfortunately for the natives, both the Crown and the continental Army would try their best to get as many Natives on their side as possible. George Washington, who fought in the French and Indian war, appreciated the Natives, and saw what great soldiers they could be. The first Natives to actually join the war joined the rebels. Some joined the British, as to stop the American invasion from Canada(1775-1776)(Makos, 2021). There were many tribes that split, including the Cherokee and the Iroquois, and technically didn’t end in 1781, when Cornwallis surrendered York Town, the year of 1782 had the war continue, and was later called “Bloody Year”. Native Americans played a major role in the Revolutionary War, a role that is often minimized or misunderstood. Including them in the history of the war is crucial to understanding the full story of the founding of the United States(Makos, 2021)</p>
